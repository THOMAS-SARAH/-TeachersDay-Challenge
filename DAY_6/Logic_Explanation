LeetCode Problem: 20 (Valid Parenthesis) 
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/submissions/1716526908/

Short Explanation:
This code checks if a string of parentheses ((), {}, []) is validâ€”meaning all opening brackets are correctly matched and closed in order.

How it works:

It uses a stack (stk) to keep track of opening brackets.
For each character:
If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
If it's a closing bracket, check if the top of the stack matches it:
If the stack is empty or doesn't match, return false.
At the end, return true only if the stack is empty (all brackets matched and closed).
This ensures every opener has a proper, timely closer.
